# Vessel-Location-Prediction
Developed predictive models to determine vessel locations for the next six hours using  AIS data. The analysis concentrated on the most impactful features for vessel routing, employing LSTM architecture and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, utilized  GeoMiniHash BERT pre-trained transformer model to enhance performance.
